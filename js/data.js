    "Description": "As a \"marsupial mouse,\" the common planigale lies somewhere between a mouse and a shrew in shape. Its body is covered in fur, though that of the tail is sparse when compared to the rest of the body. The underside of its coat is a light grayish yellow color, while the rest varies by individual from gray to a cinnamon color. This species is the largest of the genus, with a body and head length of about 100 mm (3.9 in) and a tail length of about 80 mm (3.1 in). Typical weights are close to 15 g (0.53 oz) for males and close to 11 g (0.39 oz) for females. The head of the common planigale is very narrow, giving it a flattened appearance, though less so than other planigales. Females have a well-developed pouch that opens toward the rear.",
    "Habitat": "The common planigale is found from the upper Hunter River valley not far north of Sydney along the coast and hinterland to Cape York, and across the Top End of Australia to the Kimberley and a little beyond. It is also found on Groote Eylandt and on Great Keppel Island where its survival is threatened by proposed development. It occupies a wider range of habitat than other planigales, living in sclerophyll forest, rainforest, marshlands, grasslands and even the outer suburbs of Brisbanewhere it is occasionally trapped mistakenly as a house mouse. Throughout these habitats, it prefers areas with thick cover near water.",

The tree dtella's body (snout-vent) reaches a length of 55mm and a tail length of 70mm. The tree dtella has a highly variable dorsal colour which can likely be attributed to there being more than one species under the current name. Colours range from population to population from grey to brown with chequered dark and pale blotches and marbling in the eastern populations with western populations being marked with white to pale brown spots with dark bars. These patterns form an irregular reticulate pattern over the entire dorsal surface.",
    "Habitat": "The tree dtella lives in arid to sub-humid areas, including woodland, shrubland and rocky environments where dry conditions are common. It is both arboreal and saxicolous, found under loose bark and hollows on trees, and in crevices and under exfoliating rock. In trees, the tree dtella prefers sheltered sites greater than 1 metre from the ground and can also be found under ground debri.",

The arms and legs have faint barring and a slight fringe along the outer edges. The belly is cream-white and granular, with the throat and under surface of the arms and legs being black. The iris is dark brown and the pupil is vertical when constricted. The lower eyelid is patterned with lines, veins and dots which give the frog its name.

    "Description": "The kultarr is a small carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae with unique morphological features. It is nocturnal, hunting a variety of invertebrates including spiders, crickets and cockroaches. During the day it shelters in a burrows in hollow logs, beneath grass tussocks, at the base of shrubs and trees or cracks in the soil. Males weigh between 17-30 grams and 80-100 mm in length. Females are slightly smaller between 14-29 grams and 70-95 mm in length. They have a brown or fawn-sandy color, with a white underside. The kultarr has a long tail with a distinctive dark brush-like tip. The muzzle is sharply pointed and the eyes and ears are particularly large; the eyes have dark rings around them. It has distinguishing elongated hind legs having four toes similar to macropodids. The hind legs are designed for a bipedal or hopping style movement, used to evade predators and catch prey such as insects. Kultarrs have been recorded moving at speeds of 13.8 km/h in open country",
    "Habitat": "The kultarr occupies a range of different habitats preferring sparsely vegetated areas. Habitats include claypans, gibber plains, stony deserts, savannas, hummock (Triodia sp.) and tussock grasslands, woodlands and shrublands. Regional variation in habitat preference occurs with the western subspecies preferring stony, granite plains dominated by Acacia, Eremophila, and Cassiaspecies. Eastern subspecies prefer sparsely vegetated clay pans in acacia woodlands.",

The species is endemic to Australia, where it is found from New South Wales to South Queensland. While closely related to Australian sea snakes, P. dwyeri is a terrestrial reptile. P. dwyeri has a cylindrical brown body with a slender to medium build. The head is short and somewhat widened so as to be distinct from the neck. The tail is short as well, and the dorsal scales are smooth. The eye is medium-sized, with a vertically elliptical pupil.",
    "Habitat": "P. dwyeri is a secretive, nocturnal snake that seeks shelter under rocks, debris, and ground litter, and may make its home in burrows made and abandoned by other creatures. Open woodland and grassland areas are its typical habitat.",

    "Description": "The red-tailed phascogale is smaller and browner than its close relative the brush-tailed phascogale. As in the brush-tailed phascogale, male red-tailed phascogales die following their first mating as a result of stress-related diseases. Males rarely live past 11.5 months, although females can live to three years old. Captive males can also survive up to three years. An arboreal species, the red-tailed phascogale has a varied diet, and can feed on insects and spiders, but also small birds and small mammals, notably the house mouse (Mus musculus), which has become ubiquitous in the landscape since its introduction by Europeans; it does not drink as its water is metabolised through its food.",
    "Habitat": "The red-tailed phascogale was formerly widespread throughout central and western Australia but is now restricted to the southern Western Australian wheatbelt, and is classified as near threatenedby the IUCN Red List and endangered by the Australian EPBC Act. It is found in dense and tall climax vegetation, and appears to prefer those containing the Wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) and the Rock Sheoak (Allocasuarina huegeliana), as it has developed a resistance to the fluoroacetate the plants produce that is lethal to livestock. Most native animals have a resistance to this fluoracetate, but introduced species, like the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), do not, so it has been suggested that the red-tailed phascogale's survival in these areas could be attributed to this chemical. The species was reintroduced to the Wadderin Sanctuary in the central wheatbelt of Western Australia in 2009.",
